# Project Title: Unsupervised Learning - Crypto clustering

We will combine your financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills to clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods

---

## Technologies:

The project uses python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For providing data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - Provides an alternative for the static plotting API provided by Pandas and other libraries

* [path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) -  Pffers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Tool for machine learning in pythin including Kmeans (clustering), PCA (Linear dimensionality reduction), StandardScalar (standardizing data)

## Installation Guide


Before running the application first install the following dependencies:

```python
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from path import Path
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```
